# Best Practices

In July 2012, the U.S. Government Accountability Office identified 10 practices for applying Agile software development methods to government IT projects.

From the GAO report:

> “The practices generally align with five key software development project management activities: strategic planning, organizational commitment and collaboration, preparation, execution, and evaluation. Officials who have used Agile methods on federal projects generally agreed that these practices are effective.”
