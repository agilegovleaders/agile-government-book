# About Agile

Agile management or agile project management is an iterative and incremental method of managing the design and build activities for engineering, information technology, and new product or service development projects in a highly flexible and interactive manner. *(Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_management))*

## History

On February 11-13, 2001, 17 representatives from Extreme Programming, Scrum, DSDM, Adaptive Software Development, Crystal, Feature-Driven Development, Pragmatic Programming and others sympathetic to the need for an alternative to documentation driven, heavyweight software development processes convened. The result was the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org). *(Source: [agilemanifesto.org](http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html))*

## Manifesto

*From [agilemanifesto.org](http://agilemanifesto.org/):*

> ### Manifesto for Agile Software Development

> We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation

> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

> **Responding to change** over following a plan

> That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Principles

*From [agilemanifesto.org](http://agilemanifesto.org/):*

> We follow these principles:

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
> through early and continuous delivery
> of valuable software.

> Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
> development. Agile processes harness change for 
> the customer's competitive advantage.

> Deliver working software frequently, from a 
> couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
> preference to the shorter timescale.

> Business people and developers must work 
> together daily throughout the project.

> Build projects around motivated individuals. 
> Give them the environment and support they need, 
> and trust them to get the job done.

> The most efficient and effective method of 
> conveying information to and within a development 
team is face-to-face conversation.

> Working software is the primary measure of progress.

> Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
> The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

> Continuous attention to technical excellence 
> and good design enhances agility.

> Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
> of work not done--is essential.

> The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
> emerge from self-organizing teams.

> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
> to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly.
