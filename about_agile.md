# About Agile

Agile management or agile project management is an iterative and incremental method of managing the design and build activities for engineering, information technology, and new product or service development projects in a highly flexible and interactive manner. *(Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_management))*

## History

On February 11-13, 2001, 17 representatives from Extreme Programming, Scrum, DSDM, Adaptive Software Development, Crystal, Feature-Driven Development, Pragmatic Programming and others sympathetic to the need for an alternative to documentation driven, heavyweight software development processes convened. The result was the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org). *(Source: [agilemanifesto.org](http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html))*

## Manifesto

*From [agilemanifesto.org](http://agilemanifesto.org/):*

> ### Manifesto for Agile Software Development

> We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation

> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

> **Responding to change** over following a plan

> That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
