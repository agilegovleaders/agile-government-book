# "Getting it."

"He just doesnt get it." "We need to wait till he retires." "It is impossible to change this place."

Agile development has an advantage over Waterfall - but fails when organizations can't adapt to change. According to Standish Group study, only 34% of change projects are successful. Further studies by Kotter, McKinsey, Prosci and others indicate that people related problems are responsible for 60% of the failures. 

Employee attitudes and management behavior appears to be the cause. As Jason Little wrote in his book "Lean Change Management" - it's the "unpredictable nature of those pesky humans."

In another field, Neuroscience, we are discovering that much of this 'nature' is actually predictable.
