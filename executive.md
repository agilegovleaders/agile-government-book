# Executive (Control)

## Core Balance Concerns

Every Style risks falling into "the trigger zone" when their "core balance concerns" aren't being met. The Executive becomes susceptible to losing balance when:
* There is uncertainty about the direction we're going - *why are we doing this*?
* The conversation or activity lacks sufficient context - *why are we talking about this*?
* There is a lack of clarity about what we're doing - *what's the point*?
* People are diligently working, but there doesn't appear to be a good plan in place.
* A breakdown happens that "could have been avoided" - they HATE surprises!
* He/she doesn't have good answers to important questions that others are asking.
* Others start to think that the Executive don't know what he/she is doing.


## Triggered Behaviors
* Dictating - barking orders, telling others what to do
* Covering up - making up answers and delivering them confidently
* Arrogance - other people are stupid, they don't "get it
* Bullying - belittling others, forcing them to do things against their will
