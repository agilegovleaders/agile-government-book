# Executive (Control)

## Triggers

Every Style risks falling into "the trigger zone" when their "core balance concerns" aren't being met. The Executive becomes susceptible to losing balance when:
* The conversation or activity lacks context.
* There is uncertainty about the direction we're going.
* People are diligently working but there doesn't appear to be a plan.
* There is a lack of clarity as to why we're doing what we're doing or there seems to be no point to what we're doing at all.
* He/she doesn't have good answers to important questions.
* Others think that the Executive don't know what he/she is doing.
* When a breakdown happens that "could have been avoided" - they HATE surprises!
