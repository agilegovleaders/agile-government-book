# Executive

## Triggers

Every Style risks falling into the trigger zone when their core balance concerns aren't being met. The Executive will lose balance when:
* There's no plan
* It is unclear where we're going or they are uncertain about direction
* It looks to others that they don't know something
* What we're doing lacks context
* They don't know why we're doing what we're doing
* When there seems to be no point
