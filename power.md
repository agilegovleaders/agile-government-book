# Power
People of the Power Style are consistent. They take things on and will work forever to get them finished. This endurance is a tremendous benefit to a team because it pulls people alongside them who want to make sure things get accomplished. Powers typically become the glue in a relationship—staying in touch, keeping tabs, etc.

When Powers are on a team, they tend to focus on getting down to business and getting to work.  If the work priorities change daily or things feel too chaotic, Powers tend to get anxious.  This can lead them to taking on all of the work (way more than they can handle) just to avoid things feeling unstable.

This is just one of the many ways you can unknowingly trigger a Power. Following are specific characteristics about a Power that are helpful to know when working with them.


## Preferences

* Powers prefer to learn by doing, meaning that they would rather jump into action than over-talk or over-analyze something.

* The word Team to Powers means the people they roll up their sleeves and get the work done with.

* Power would rather receive an action plan than spend a lot of time discussing the strategy or reviewing the details, and prefer friendly work-related updates over idle chit chat.


## Core Balance Concerns

Powers risk falling into "the trigger zone" when their following "core balance concerns" aren't being met:

* A team is spending too much time on the big picture – when are we going to get to work?
* An activity lacks an emphasis on results – where are the points on the board?
* Others don’t seem to be working hard – why am I the only one?
* We are reviewing every detail and not moving forward when there is work to be done.
* Others are over-thinking a breakdown and not just moving on to fix it.
* He/she doesn't feel like they have enough to do.
* Others exclude the Power because they are too busy – they want a seat at the table.


## Triggered Behaviors

Once Powers fall into "the trigger zone" their survival strategies will cause them to engage in the following behaviors:

* **Tolerating** - focusing on being busy instead of prioritizing tasks.
* **Undermining** - gossiping about how a process isn’t working properly instead of addressing an issue directly.
* **Frustration** - why aren't others working as hard as I am?
* **Being a Pushover** - others giving them work to avoid doing work themselves.

Once in a triggered state, they aren't even aware they are acting like this. Their survival strategy is guiding them to calm their own biology in this manner.


## Alignment

Following are suggestions for ways to work successfully with a Power. The key is to avoid triggering them while offering them what they need to remained balanced:
•	Build rapport with them by coming alongside them and demonstrating that you are willing to work hard as well.. 
•	Begin conversations with them on personal issues as Powers tend to want to have professional friendships.  However, move to the task list relatively quickly in order to show that you are focused on getting the work done.   
•	Make offers of support to build review mechanisms that will enable the team to know if the hard work we are doing is paying off.
