# What They Say

> “Agile does three fundamental things that are different from traditional methods. First, agile embraces change as a constant. Change is expected, constantly planned for, and prioritized in real-time . . . Second, agile time-boxes risk into 30-90 day “sprints.” This “if you’re going to fail, fail early” risks only that amount of project time instead of finding issues late in a multi-month or multi-year project. Finally, agile techniques allow us to incrementally deliver higher quality products with improved features that are based on our users’ needs.”

> “We are trying to get some best practices for agile contracts, so if you choose to buy a piece of technology from a vendor in an agile way, we can specify the business value we want out of it, and provide reasonable checks and balances to make sure we are building something that satisfies that business value without trying to define every little thing.”

> “With Agile the team can now focus on a single product in a short development sprint (at the moment we use 3 week sprints). This has empowered our team and we are seeing improved quality with better knowledge transfer and peer review process. We also have a faster release cycle with more work being included each release. Furthermore, the individuals in the team retain their existing expertise but now also broaden their skills and are experienced across a number of products.”
