## Introduction

During the first half-dozen interviews with agile evangelists in government, we heard a common theme: ***"He just doesnt get it." "We need to wait till he retires." "It is impossible to change this place.***"

Quick to jump to a fix, people asked for tools and processes. We almost followed that urgent request, but then we stepped back and decided to follow the thread of people.

During that first sprint to write this book, we reviewed the **first** value listed in the Agile Manifesto: **Individuals and Interactions over process and tools**. We immediately saw that value in a different light.

It became even more clear that changing culture was critical to the adoption of agile in government. Of course there are very real policy and legal barriers to overcome as well. Fortunately, there are many incredible people inside government who are creating avenues to adopt agile. This includes work like the TechFar, which shows the path to procuring agile in government.

While this book will include many of these tools and processes that have been documented by 18f, US Digital Service, and other initiatives, we have paid very close attention to individuals and interactions and how to implement these practices with empathetic human interactions.

While Agile development has an advantage over Waterfall, it fails when organizations can't adapt to change. According to Standish Group study, only 34% of change projects are successful. Further studies by Kotter, McKinsey, Prosci and others indicate that people related problems are responsible for 60% of the failures. 

This research indicates that employee attitudes and management behavior appears to be the cause. As Jason Little wrote in his book "Lean Change Management" - it's the "unpredictable nature of those pesky humans."
