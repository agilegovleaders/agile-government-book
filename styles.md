# Styles
As the field of neuroscience illustrates, a person's behavior is predictable whenever his primitive brain confuses the pressure he is experiencing in the moment with a threat to his life. When a person gets triggered in this way, his biology automatically runs a hard-wired survival strategy in a misguided attempt to save his life.


## Survival Strategies
It turns out that not all survival strategies are built the same. In nature we consistently find the following four primary strategies designed to save animals' lives, whether the threat is from another animal or the environment itself, like the coming of winter:

* **Dictate** - Tackling a threat head-on, through attack or some form of manipulation. Some examples of animals that use this strategy are sharks, rhinoceros, lions and beavers.

* **Migrate** - Fleeing from a threat, through outrunning, outmaneuvering or out-traveling. Some examples of animals that use this strategy are whales, antelope, birds and butterflies.

* **Tolerate** - Outlasting the threat, relying on innate survival qualities such as protection or disguise. Some examples of animals that use this strategy are buffalo, crabs, porcupines and chameleons.

* **Hibernate** - Simply pulling in from the environment and allowing the threat to safely pass. Some examples of animals that use this strategy are bears, tortoises, bats, snakes, rodents and bees.

These strategies run within the same animal species, meaning all rhinos will charge straight at a problem, while all antelopes will run away from a threat as quickly as possible.


## Survival Characteristics
Animals aren't just hard-wired with a survival strategy, they also developed supportive physical characteristics that increase the likelihood of survival success. For example, beavers have the perfect equipment for cutting down trees and constructing dams while spiders are capable of, and adept at, spinning webs and bears have the ability to slow down their metabolism for extended periods of time.

Interestingly though, we find that humans are the exception to this rule. For some reason, the human species is capable of using all four survival strategies. And, for some even stranger reason, in spite of our physical similarity to each other, every person favors a primary strategy, which is what forms the basis for the four Style distinctions in this section.





## Distinctions
[Market Force](www.marketforceglobal.com) has distinguished the following four Styles according to their respective survival strategies:

**[Control](control.md)**: Dictate 

Controls get triggered whenever they feel uncertain about the direction a project, conversation or relationship is headed. This causes them feel out of control, so to relieve the perceived pressure, they will tell others what to do or just take over. Their approach can be a bit like a bull in a china shop, but it helps them feel more in control of their environment.
