Human behavior is predictable...

## Neuroscience
One of the primary things separating the human experience from the animal kingdom is that we humans have developed an extraordinary capacity to experience multiple types of pressure (or risk) in our lives. This is no small feat given that we share the same biological imperative for survival as our animal counterparts.

While animals only deal with pressure associated with anything that threatens their lives, humans have advanced to the point where survival ranks as only one of our primary concerns. And while it remains a very important one for us, we also put a lot of our attention on what other people think about us and how that impacts our ability to earn a living, advance our careers and build community.

Interestingly, while we have expanded our capacity for things that concern us, our method for handling them remains pretty much the same. This is because our brain has a really hard time distinguishing between actual risk (threat of death) and perceived risk (threat of humiliation).

This is where the neuroscience provides a fascinating explanation for what is going on.

The human brain is comprised of three primary areas:
* The most primitive part is called the amygdala. It's about the size of an almond, it is the first part of the brain that forms in utero and it sits at the base of the brain stem. Its primary role is to act as a human highlighter, constantly scanning your environment for potential threats. It is sometimes referred to as the "lizard brain" because it is the only brain that a reptile has and it is found in the brains of all animals.

* The amygdala resides inside of the wider limbic system, which is the area of our brains responsible for our basic drives for things such as hunger, sex, dominance, care for offspring, as well as the place where we experience emotions, moods, motivations and also where our instincts come from. The limbic system is also the storage area for long-term memory, which is relevant because it explains why our memories tend to be more emotionally based than factual.

* Finally, at the outermost layer you will find the neocortex, which is the largest and most complex part of the human brain. The neocortex is involved with all higher functions such as sensory perception, spatial reasoning, language and complex thought. It could be argued that the neocortex is the thing that makes us uniquely human, that is until the moment we experience pressure.

When a human is exposed to a high enough level of pressure, for instance the moment you stand up to present in front of a room full of people or when you are working up against a tight deadline, the brain loses the ability to distinguish between actual and perceived risk and the amygdala kicks into high gear to protect you from the threat.


That is to say, while we are advanced beings living in a modern world, we are still operating on a primitive biology.
