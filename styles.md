# Styles
As the field of neuroscience illustrates, a person's behavior is predictable whenever his primitive brain confuses the pressure he is experiencing in the moment with a threat to his life. When a person gets triggered in this way, his biology automatically runs a hard-wired survival strategy in a misguided attempt to save his life.


## Survival Strategies
It turns out that not all survival strategies are built the same. In nature we consistently find the following four primary strategies designed to save animals' lives, whether the threat is from another animal or the environment itself, like the coming of winter:

* **Dictate** - Tackling a threat head-on, through attack or some form of manipulation. Some examples of animals that use this strategy are sharks, rhinoceros, lions and beavers.

* **Migrate** - Fleeing from a threat, through outrunning, outmaneuvering or out-traveling. Some examples of animals that use this strategy are whales, antelope, birds and butterflies.

* **Tolerate** - Outlasting the threat, relying on innate survival qualities such as protection or disguise. Some examples of animals that use this strategy are buffalo, crabs, porcupines and chameleons.

* **Hibernate** - Simply pulling in from the environment and allowing the threat to safely pass. Some examples of animals that use this strategy are bears, tortoises, bats, snakes, rodents and bees.

These strategies run within the same animal species, meaning all rhinos will charge straight at a problem, while all antelopes will run away from a threat as quickly as possible.


## Survival Characteristics
Animals aren't just hard-wired with a survival strategy, they also developed supportive physical characteristics that increase the likelihood of survival success. For example, beavers have the perfect equipment for cutting down trees and constructing dams while spiders are capable of, and adept at, spinning webs and bears have the ability to slow down their metabolism for extended periods of time.

Interestingly though, we find that humans are the exception to this rule. For some reason, the human species is capable of using all four survival strategies. And, for some even stranger reason, in spite of our physical similarity to each other, every person favors a primary strategy, which is what forms the basis for the four Style distinctions in this section.





## Distinctions
[Market Force](www.marketforceglobal.com) has distinguished the following four Styles according to their respective survival strategies:

**[Controls](control.md)** ***dictate*** under pressure.

They get triggered whenever they deem that the direction a project, conversation or relationship is headed is unclear or uncertain. The idea that nobody is driving the ship causes them great anxiety. To relieve the pressure they feel, Controls will naturally begin telling others what to do or simply take over. Their approach can feel like a bull in a china shop to those around them, but it helps them feel greater control of their environment.

**[Influences](influence.md)** ***migrate*** under pressure.

They get triggered whenever they feel a loss of freedom. When they are forced to do something in a particular way, if a project takes too long or when they are assigned repetitive tasks, Influences will get impatient and nervous, often complaining about feeling "fenced in". They get itchy feet easily, so to relieve the pressure they feel, Influences tend to migrate away from the existing work to a different environment where they can help influence others to start something new. 

**[Power](power.md)** ***tolerate*** under pressure.

They like it when things are predictable and get triggered when faced with  instability in their environment. Powers like to know what they are supposed to do and love to work off of action plans and to-do lists. However, when there isn't enough work, or when things get too chaotic, Powers can easily get frustrated. To relieve the pressure they feel, Powers will take on more work because it feels good to put their head down and power through a bunch of tasks.

**[Authority](authority.md)** ***hibernate*** under pressure.

The feeling of security is very important to Authorities and they get triggered when they are unsure how things will turn out. When a project moves forward or a decision gets made with insufficient evidence to support their direction, Authorities will feel nervous and get agitated, often seeing others as irresponsible. To relieve the pressure they feel, they will often pull away from the group back to their own desk to review as much data as possible on a subject in order to become the authority on the topic to ensure a better outcome.
