# Styles
As the field of neuroscience illustrates, a person's behavior is predictable whenever his primitive brain confuses the pressure he is experiencing in the moment with a threat to his life. When a person gets triggered in this way, his biology automatically runs a hard-wired survival strategy in a misguided attempt to save his life.

It turns out that not all survival strategies are built the same. In nature we consistently find the following four primary strategies designed to save animals' lives:
* Dictate - Tackling the threat head on, through an attack or some form of manipulation.
* Migrate - Fleeing from a threat as quickly as possible, through outrunning or outmaneuvering.
* Tolerate - Outlasting the threat, relying on innate survival 
* Hibernate -
* that consistently run within the same animal species, meaning that all rhinos respond to threats in the same way - which is to charge straight at a problem - while all antelopes will respond in a completely different way - which is to run away from a threat as quickly as possible.


Interestingly though, we find that humans are the exception to this rule. For some reason, we got all four survival strategies. And, for some even stranger reason, you as a human actually have a primary one that you favor, and this is what forms the basis for the four Style distinctions in this section.
