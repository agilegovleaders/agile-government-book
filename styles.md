# Styles
As the neuroscience illustrates, a person's behavior is predictable just as long as his primitive brain confuses the pressure he is experiencing in the moment with a threat to his life. In such a situation, his biology automatically starts running his hard-wired survival strategy in a misguided attempt to save his life.

It turns out that not all survival strategies are built the same. In nature we find four primary strategies that consistently run within the same animal species, meaning that all rhinos respond to threats in the same way while all antelopes will respond in a completely different way. Interestingly though, we find that humans are the exception to this rule, and for some reason, we got all four survival strategies. For some even stranger reason, you as a human have a primary one that you use and this is what forms the basis for the four Style distinctions in this section.

**[Control](control.md)**: These people tend focus on the future and create vision.

**[Influence](influence.md)**: These people tend focus on the future and create vision.
