## Neuroscience
One of the primary things separating the human experience from the animal kingdom is that we advanced beings have developed the extraordinary capacity to experience multiple types of pressure (or risk). This is no small feat given that we all share the same biological imperative for survival and reproduction.

So, while animals only deal with a singular type of pressure, which is anything that represents a threat to their lives, humans have advanced to the point where survival ranks as only one of our concerns. And while it remains a very important one for us, we also put a lot of our attention on what other people think about us and how that impacts our ability to earn a living, advance in our careers and build community.

Interestingly, while we have expanded our capacity for things that concern us, our method for handling that remains pretty much the same.

brains are only capable of handling them in a single way. That is to say, while we are advanced beings living in a modern world, we are still operating on a primitive biology.

What happens to the human brain under pressure is quite interesting.

**[Control](control.md)**: These people tend focus on the future and create vision.

**[Influence](influence.md)**: These people tend focus on the future and create vision.

**[Power](power.md)**: These people tend focus on the future and create vision.

**[Authority](authority.md)**: These people tend focus on the future and create vision.
