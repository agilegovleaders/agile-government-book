# Styles
As the neuroscience illustrates, a person's behavior is predictable just as long as his primitive brain confuses the pressure he is experiencing in the moment with a threat to his life. In such a situation, his biology automatically starts running his hard-wired survival strategy in a misguided attempt to save his life.

It turns out that not all survival strategies are the same. In nature we find four primary strategies that consistently run within the same animal species, meaning that all rhinos respond to threats in the same way and antelope respond completely differently. Interestingly though, we find that humans got all four sruvival strategies. This is what forms the basis for the four Styles in this section.





## Distinctions
[Market Force](www.marketforceglobal.com) relates the following four Styles to their respective survival strategies:

**[Control](control.md)**: These people tend focus on the future and create vision.

**[Influence](influence.md)**: These people tend focus on the future and create vision.

**[Power](power.md)**: These people tend focus on the future and create vision.

**[Authority](authority.md)**: These people tend focus on the future and create vision.
