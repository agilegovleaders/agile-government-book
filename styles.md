Human behavior is predictable...

## Neuroscience
One of the primary things separating the human experience from the animal kingdom is that we humans have developed an extraordinary capacity to experience multiple types of pressure (or risk) in our lives. This is no small feat given that we share the same biological imperative for survival and reproduction as our animal counterparts.

While animals only deal with the singular type of pressure of anything that threatens their lives, humans have advanced to the point where survival ranks as only one of our primary concerns. And while it remains a very important one for us, we also put a lot of our attention on what other people think about us and how that impacts our ability to earn a living, advance our careers and build community.

Interestingly, while we have expanded our capacity for things that concern us, our method for handling them remains pretty much the same. This is because our brain has a really hard time distinguishing between actual risk (threat of death) and perceived risk (threat of humiliation).

This is where the neuroscience provides a fascinating explanation for what is going on.

The human brain is comprised of three primary areas:
* The most primitive part is called the amygdala. It is the first part of the brain that forms in utero and it sits at the base of the brain stem. It's about the size of an almond and it acts as a human highlighter, constantly scanning your environment for potential threats. It is sometimes referred to as the "lizard brain" because it is the only brain that a reptile has and it is found in the brains of all animals.

* The amygdala resides inside of the wider limbic system, the area responsible for our basic drives for things such as hunger, sex, dominance, care for offspring, as well as the place where we experience emotions, moods, motivations and our instincts. The limbic system is also the storage area for long-term memory.

* Finally, the neocortex is the outer layer of the brain. It represents the largest part of the human brain and is comprised of a complex system of nerves, neurons and networks. This is the part of our brain that is involved with higher functions such as sensory perception, spatial reasoning, conscious thought and language.

That is to say, while we are advanced beings living in a modern world, we are still operating on a primitive biology.


## Distinctions
[Market Force](www.marketforceglobal.com) relates the following four Styles to their respective survival strategies:

**[Control](control.md)**: These people tend focus on the future and create vision.

**[Influence](influence.md)**: These people tend focus on the future and create vision.

**[Power](power.md)**: These people tend focus on the future and create vision.

**[Authority](authority.md)**: These people tend focus on the future and create vision.
