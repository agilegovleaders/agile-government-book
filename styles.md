# Styles
As the neuroscience illustrates, a person's behavior is predictable just as long as his primitive brain confuses the pressure he is experiencing in the moment with a threat to his life. In such a situation, his biology automatically starts running that person's hard-wired survival strategy in a misguided attempt to save his life.

It turns out that not all survival strategies are the same. In nature we find that there are four primary strategies that consistently run within the same species. Interestingly, humans got all four.
