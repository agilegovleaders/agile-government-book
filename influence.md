# Influence
People with an Influence Style are typically go, go, go. They are relationship-oriented and tend to create friendships very easily. They look for the unique approach, the different way, the out-of-the-box possibility. Their attitude can be infectious - positive or negative - and when harnessed, it can help a team produce tremendous momentum. Their desire is to be first on behalf of others, so they tend to be early adapters to change.

When Influences are in team environment, they often want to be able to contribute by starting something new rather than working on an existing project. If instead the team attempts to constrain an Influence with repetitive tasks, the Influence will tend to push back because they will feel like they are being told what to do, which is a core fear.

This is just one of the many ways you can unknowingly trigger an Influence. Following are specific characteristics about an Influence that are helpful to know when working with them.


## Preferences

* Influences prefer to **learn by talking**, tending to be verbal processors who like to brainstorm new ideas or vent when they are upset because "talking it out" provides them with clarity in the moment.

* The word **Team** to Influences means the people they get to hang out with at work.

* Influences like short, **executive summaries** with **stories and pictures** to illustrate key concepts, but they really prefer friendly, verbal communication and connection.


## Core Balance Concerns

Influences risk falling into "the trigger zone" when their following "core balance concerns" aren't being met:

* The options for where to take a project are limited - *do I have any freedom here*?
* The conversation or activity lacks an emphasis on people- *why are we prioritizing the project over the people*?
* There are no openings for them to contribute - *why am I here*?
* People are diligently working, but there is no excitement in the building.
* A breakdown occurs and no one wants to acknowledge the impact on the people involved.
* A project starts to slow down and there is no feeling of movement or momentum.
* Others start to try and micromanage the Influence’s time.


## Triggered Behaviors

Once Influences fall into "the trigger zone" their survival strategies will cause them to engage in the following behaviors:

* **Migrating** – not being around, finding other new projects to start.
* **Sacrificing** – agreeing to do things just to get meetings over with, then not doing them.
* **Impatience** – others are moving too slowly, “I have to get out of here.”
* **Flakiness** – not showing up for meetings or conference calls, not following through on commitments.

Once in a triggered state, they aren't even aware they are acting like this. Their survival strategy is guiding them to calm their own biology in this manner.


## Alignment

Following are suggestions for ways to work successfully with an Influence. The key is to avoid triggering them while offering them what they need to remained balanced:

* Build rapport with them by acknowledging their value to the team as a person.

* Begin conversations with them on personal issues, and then ease into the business-related conversations.  If you have less time, ask permission to get down to business quickly.  The key is being authentic about the relationship.

* Make offers of support to build structures around the projects they are starting so that they can have the freedom to move on to new projects.
