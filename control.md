# Control
People with a Control Style tend to be strong-willed, independent-thinkers who usually focus on the big picture. They can't be bothered with the details, but would rather spend their time coming up with great ideas for the future. Controls donâ€™t often have the best people skills and can struggle with relationships. They don't often enjoy a lot of chit chat but they do love telling other people what to do.

When Controls do or say something, they are not just offering a suggestion, they are actually demonstrating how they want things to be done. In other words, they are illustrating the "right way" to do things. If you disagree with their approach, you are communicating to them that you think they are wrong, and they won't easily agree with you.

This is just one of the many ways you can unknowingly trigger a Control. Following are specific characteristics about a Control that are helpful to know when working with them.

## Preferences
* Controls prefer to **learn by thinking**, meaning that if they aren't sure how to respond to something, they will often "go into their head", practicing and refining the right response so that when they eventually share it, they can stand behind it.

* The word **Team** to Controls means the people who work for them.

* Controls would rather read a high-level, **executive summary** than spend a lot of time with the details and prefer communication in **bullet points** instead of lengthy explanations. 

## Core Balance Concerns
Controls risk falling into "the trigger zone" when their following "core balance concerns" aren't being met:
* There is uncertainty about the direction a project is headed - *why are we doing this*?
* The conversation or activity lacks sufficient context - *why are we talking about this*?
* There is a lack of clarity about what we're doing - *what's the point*?
* People are diligently working, but there doesn't appear to be a good plan in place.
* A breakdown happens that could have been avoided - they HATE surprises!
* He/she doesn't have good answers to important questions that others are asking.
* Others start to think that the Control don't know what he/she is doing.


## Triggered Behaviors
Every Style risks falling into "the trigger zone" when their "core balance concerns" aren't being met. The Executive becomes susceptible to losing balance when:
* Dictating - barking orders, telling others what to do
* Covering up - making up answers and delivering them confidently
* Arrogance - other people are stupid, they don't "get it
* Bullying - belittling others, forcing them to do things against their will
