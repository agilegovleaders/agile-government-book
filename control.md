# Control
People with a Control Style are strong-willed, independent-thinkers who are focused on the big picture. They seek certainty, are future-oriented and pretty sure their ideas are right. Controls donâ€™t often have a lot of time for chit chat but they do love telling other people what to do.

When Controls do or say something, they are not just offering a suggestion, they are actually demonstrating how they want things to be done. In other words, they are illustrating the "right way" to do things. If you disagree with their approach, you are communicating to them that they are wrong. And Controls won't easily agree with you that they're wrong.

* The conversation or activity lacks sufficient context - *why are we talking about this*?
* There is a lack of clarity about what we're doing - *what's the point*?
* People are diligently working, but there doesn't appear to be a good plan in place.
* A breakdown happens that "could have been avoided" - they HATE surprises!
* He/she doesn't have good answers to important questions that others are asking.
* Others start to think that the Executive don't know what he/she is doing.
