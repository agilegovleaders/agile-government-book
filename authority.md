# Authority

People with an Authority Style tend to be all about quality control and standards. They see imperfections and areas where the team can do better, and their attention to detail is typically unmatched by the other styles. Sometimes Authorities will focus so much on where things are not working that others feel that they are too downtrodden.  However, when they jump in with an attitude for helping, rather than proving others wrong, Authorities become invaluable team members.

When Authorities speak, they tend to do so from the evidence and data, and less so from instinct or future vision.  Therefore, if an Authority person feels as though they are not being listened to (that their evidence is not being considered), they tend to pull back from active contribution and stay in more of a wait-and-see-how-it-turns-out-mode.

This is just one of the many ways you can unknowingly trigger an Authority. Following are specific characteristics about an Influence that are helpful to know when working with them.


## Preferences

* Authorities prefer to **learn by reading**, meaning that they like time to ponder and process, rather than brainstorm with others and/or making quick decisions.

* The word **Team** to Authorities means the people who they believe are up to their high standards.

* Authorities appreciate a **long report** full of supporting data - they love graphs and charts. Their preferred means of communication is written instead of verbal, as it allows them time to process and consider their position.


## Core Balance Concerns

Authorities risk falling into "the trigger zone" when their following "core balance concerns" aren't being met:

* Others appear to be dismissing their evidence - *why am I here if no one is going to listen to the facts*?
* The project lacks an emphasis on data - *how do we know this is going to work*?
* Things are moving too quickly - *this feels out of control*.
* People are diligently working, but the results are low quality or not in order of priority.
* A breakdown happens that they warned others about earlier - "see, I told you so!"
* Feeling unprepared for a meeting as they did not receive materials beforehand.
* Others start to think that the Authority is incompetent.


## Triggered Behaviors

Once Influences fall into "the trigger zone" their survival strategies will cause them to engage in the following behaviors:

* **Hibernating** - pulling back from a team and working more by themselves.
* **Capitulation** - letting others take the lead even though they disagree.
* **Indifference** - not contributing during a project but saying "I told you so" if something does not work.
* **Blocking** - using evidence to try and win every argument, slowing a process to a halt.

Once in a triggered state, they aren't even aware they are acting like this. Their survival strategy is guiding them to calm their own biology in this manner.


## Alignment

Following are suggestions for ways to work successfully with an Authority. The key is to avoid triggering them while offering them what they need to remained balanced:

* Build rapport with them by acknowledging assessments as important and heard, even if we donâ€™t act on all of them.

* Begin conversations with them by letting them download their opinions, especially around problem areas.  Only once they have downloaded are Authorities typically open to considering what to do moving forward.

* Make offers of support to help them make the best decisions going forward, ones that will help ensure the success of the project.
