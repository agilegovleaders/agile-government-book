# Questions to Ask

18F suggests asking the following questions to help determine whether you're ready to implement Agile:

> * Are you willing to have a subset of your target audience use the product before itâ€™s polished?
* Are you willing to talk about the process of development with outside groups to gather feedback?
* Are you prepared to change direction rapidly on projects as the problem and possible solutions are understood more deeply?
* Has a specific solution already been promised to stakeholders with a deadline?
* Have you thought about or defined desired business outcomes (such as KPIs)?
* Is your product owner committed to participating in co-design activities, like design studios or constructive critique?
