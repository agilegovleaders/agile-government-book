## Wiring
Neuroscience shows that a large part of human behavior is actually hard-wired into our brains through set patterns of neuron flow that scientists refer to as neuropathways. Think of these pathways as railroad tracks that your thoughts dutifully follow, creating the same, predictable patterns of behavior over and over again.

One thing that we are all hard-wired for is survival. When our lives are threatened, our biology kicks into gear steering us toward a fight or flight response designed to save our lives. We do this completely without conscious thought. Often times when people survive a near-death experience they struggle to recall what happened.

## Beyond Survival
But our neuropathways go beyond survival. Do something for long enough and it is likely to become a habit, that is to say you do it a lot and you're not even aware you're doing it. You become completely unconscious to these patterns, like driving to work, brushing your teeth, even fighting with your spouse. Your brain builds these neuropathways to free up processing space allowing you to focus on more important things in your life.

One of the primary things separating the human experience from the animal kingdom is that we humans have developed an extraordinary capacity to experience multiple types of pressure (or risk) in our lives. This is no small feat given that we share the same biological imperative for survival as our animal counterparts.

While animals only deal with pressure associated with anything that threatens their lives, humans have advanced to the point where survival ranks as only one of our primary concerns. And while it remains a very important one for us, we also put a lot of our attention on what other people think about us and how that impacts our ability to earn a living, advance our careers and build community.

Interestingly, while we have expanded our capacity for things that concern us, our method for handling them remains pretty much the same. This is because our brain has a really hard time distinguishing between actual risk (threat of death) and perceived risk (threat of humiliation).

This is where the neuroscience provides a fascinating explanation for what is going on.


## Losing Your Mind

The human brain is comprised of three primary areas:
* The most primitive part is called the amygdala. It's about the size of an almond, it is the first part of the brain that forms in utero and it sits at the base of the brain stem. Its primary role is to act as a human highlighter, constantly scanning your environment for potential threats. It is sometimes referred to as the "lizard brain" because it is the only brain that a reptile has and it can be found in the brains of all animals.

* The amygdala resides inside of the wider limbic system, which is the area of our brains responsible for our basic drive for things such as hunger, sex, dominance, care for offspring, as well as the place where we experience emotions, moods, motivation and also where our basic instincts come from. The limbic system is also the storage area for long-term memory, which is relevant because it explains why our memories tend to be more emotionally based than factual.

* Finally, at the outermost layer you will find the neocortex, which is the largest and most complex part of the human brain. The neocortex is involved with all higher functions such as sensory perception, spatial reasoning, language and complex thought. It could be argued that the neocortex is the thing that makes us uniquely human, that is until the moment we experience pressure.

When exposed to a high enough level of pressure, for instance when you find yourself with two more hours of work to do on a project that is due in 30 minutes or when you are being asked by the press to comment on a scandal, the human brain loses its ability to distinguish between actual and perceived risk and the amygdala kicks into high gear to protect you from the threat.

It releases a cocktail of neurochemicals into your brain as a strategy to ensure survival. Seratonin floods the neocortex to pacify it, then the limbic system gets shots of dopamine, which reduces inhibitions, and adrenaline, which is an extreme upper. In this moment, the most primitive part of your brain is being encouraged to do whatever it wants as fast as it can, which is to defend your life.


That is to say, while we are advanced beings living in a modern world, we are still operating on a primitive biology.
