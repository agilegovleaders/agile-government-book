## Wiring
Neuroscience shows us that a large part of human behavior is actually hard-wired into our brains through set patterns of neuron flow that scientists refer to as neuropathways. Think of these pathways as railroad tracks that your thoughts dutifully follow, creating the same, predictable patterns of behavior over and over again.

One thing that we are all hard-wired for is survival. When our lives are threatened, our biology kicks into high gear steering us toward a fight or flight response designed to save our lives. We do this completely without conscious thought. Often times when people survive a near-death experience they struggle to recall what even happened. One of the reasons for this is that the part of the brain that takes over in such moments generally lacks language.

Interestingly, this hard-wired pattern of behavior is more easily triggered than you might think and your survival strategy is often employed in situations when there is no actual threat to your life.

## Beyond Survival
But our neuropathways go beyond survival. Do something for long enough and it is likely to become a habit, that is to say you do it a lot and you're not even aware you're doing it. You become completely unconscious to these patterns, like driving to work, brushing your teeth, even fighting with your spouse. Your brain builds these neuropathways to free up processing space allowing you to focus on more important things in your life.

One of the primary things separating the human experience from the animal kingdom is that we humans have developed an extraordinary capacity to experience multiple types of pressure (or risk) in our lives, which is to say we have many different concerns. This is no small feat given that we share the same biological imperative for survival as our animal counterparts.

While animals only deal with pressure associated with threats to their lives, humans have advanced to the point where survival ranks as only one of our primary concerns. And while it remains a very important one for us, we also put a lot of our attention on what other people think about us and how that impacts our ability to earn a living, advance our careers and build a healthy community.

Within milliseconds, a potent cocktail of neurochemicals shoots into your brain as a strategy to ensure your survival. Seratonin floods the neocortex in order to pacify it, then the limbic system gets shots of dopamine, which reduces inhibitions, and adrenaline, which is like caffeine on caffeine. In this moment, the most primitive part of your brain is being encouraged to do whatever it wants as fast as it can, which is to defend your life, and you quite literally lose your mind.

So, while we are advanced beings living in a modern world, it turns out we are still operating on a primitive biology. And under pressure, that biology predictably runs its hard-wired survival strategy every time it determines a threat, most of the time however your life isn't at stake.
