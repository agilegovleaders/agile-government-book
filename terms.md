## Stand-ups

A meeting with attendees typically standing. The discomfort of standing for long periods helps to keep the meetings short. The meetings are usually timeboxed to 5–15 minutes and are held standing up to remind people to keep the meeting short and to-the-point. There are three questions to ask and answer in the daily stand-up (“What did I accomplish yesterday?” / “What will I do today?” / “What obstacles are impeding my progress?”) *(Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting))*

## User stories
